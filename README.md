A function that takes two column vectors and does linear regression on the data


A function that takes two column vectors and does linear regression on the data. It assumes that the data is logged. It takes two column vectors, a description, x label and y label and does the linear regression. It then plots the data and outputs all the statistics (r-squared, OLS slope, RMA slope and 95% confidence intervals)
